Your staff should be aware that good hygiene practices must be in place to prevent any contact between raw food and cooked products; for example, the liquid from thawing foods, especially frozen poultry, must not be allowed to contaminate wiping cloths, high-risk food, or equipment used for high-risk food.</para>
        <para id="id21869591">Raw materials that may contain foreign bodies, which will be undesirable in the finished product, require careful inspection prior to acceptance or must undergo specific preparation as part of the production process.

        <para id="id15269320">As a food safety manager, you should be aware of any potential chemical, physical, or biological hazards which may be present in specific raw materials. You need to have a pre-acceptance inspection system in place to assess the acceptability of raw material coming into your facility.</para>
        <para id="id15410040">When you receive raw materials after the pre-acceptance inspection is done, a post-receipt inspection system must be in place to code the raw materials entering your premises so that they can be identified. This is a necessary step in preventing contamination issues later. Your traceability system should also include where and how the raw material is stored and where the raw material is eventually used. </para>
        <para id="id17402289">When using raw materials, use color-coded wiping cloths and chopping boards. They are essential in preventing cross-contamination of products.</para>

        <para id="id11126623">Packaging should not itself pose a hazard and should be suitable for its purpose. For example, packaging should be strong enough not to break during filling, processing, or storage. </para>
        <para id="id15134009">Packaging used for the storage of raw materials is very important in preventing product contamination. There should be an appropriate barrier to prevent contact between raw materials, ingredients, and finished product. </para>
        <para id="id17415764">During manufacture, any unused packaging that has been removed from its protective outer packaging should be suitably protected before being returned to storage.</para>
